let’s turn the decomposition into a strength evaluation. Here’s a compact rubric you can reuse, then I’ll score “1+1=2”.

Strength rubric (for any statement S)

For each axis, score 0–1 (higher = stronger). Multiply or report vector; both are useful.

Axiomatic Minimality (AM)
How few independent assumptions are required?

1.0: provable in a tiny, canonical base (e.g., PA/PRA).

0.7: needs a mainstream but heavier base (e.g., ZFC, full second-order).

0.3: needs exotic/controversial axioms.

0.0: unaxiomatized reliance.

Derivation Tightness (DT)
Shortest/cleanest proof length and lack of “lemmas of convenience.”

1.0: few steps, purely definitional/primitive-recursive.

0.7: moderate chain but standard.

0.3: long or brittle derivation.

0.0: no proof.

Cross-Foundation Robustness (CFR)
Number and independence of foundations in which S holds with transport maps.

1.0: PA, ZFC(ω), and Type Theory/HoTT all prove it; known conservativity.

0.7: ≥2 independent foundations.

0.3: only one.

0.0: none.

Failure-Mode Sparsity (FMS)
How many minimal perturbations would falsify S; fewer = stronger.
Let k = count of truly minimal, non-overlapping perturbations; define
FMS = 1 / (1 + log₂(1+k)). (So 0 faults → 1.0; 3–5 faults → ~0.6–0.5).

Concept/Evidence Separation Integrity (CESI)
Was meaning vs justification cleanly separated (low circularity)?

1.0: definitions vs proofs fully disjoint; no presupposition of S.

0.7: minor bleed.

0.3: noticeable circularity.

0.0: circular.

Normalization/Computation Witness (NCW)
Does S reduce to a canonical normal form in at least one computational semantics (e.g., type-theoretic normalization, certified TRS run)?

1.0: yes, with machine-checked trace.

0.7: yes, informal.

0.3: unclear.

0.0: no.

Model-Theoretic Stability (MTS)
Truth preserved across all standard models intended by the theory?

1.0: true in every standard model of the base theory.

0.7: true in intended model, unknown in all nonstandard models.

0.3: depends on a particular model variant.

0.0: model-fragile.

Proof-Theoretic Security (PTS)
Distance from known inconsistency or unsound rules (cut-elimination, conservativity results present?).

1.0: supported by cut-elimination / conservativity / small trusted kernels.

0.7: partially.

0.3: weak.

0.0: none.

Interpretation Load (IL) (penalty; lower is better)
How many distinct substrate choices must be jointly assumed?
Define IL = min(1, 0.1 × (#simultaneous independent substrates)). If you prove in one foundation, IL≈0. If you require multiple simultaneously, IL↑.

Empirical Exposure (EE) (NA for pure math; else, does it hinge on instruments/calibration?)
For math like 1+1=2, set EE = 1.0 by convention (no empirical load). For empirical claims, down-weight by uncertainty budget.

Apply to S = “1+1=2”

AM: 1.0 — provable in PRA/PA with primitive recursion.

DT: 1.0 — 4–5 line derivation once + is defined.

CFR: 1.0 — PA, ZFC(ω via finite ordinals), and HoTT/MLTT all prove it with known transports.

FMS: Minimal perturbation set is tiny and very specific (e.g., drop successor injectivity; alter + base/step clause; break equality congruence; remove induction/recursor). Call k≈4 ⇒ FMS ≈ 1/(1+log₂(5)) ≈ 0.68.

CESI: 1.0 — meanings (defs) vs proof steps are cleanly separated.

NCW: 1.0 — normalizes in type theory; executable TRS trace exists.

MTS: 1.0 — true in all standard models of PA; also holds in nonstandard models since it’s a quantifier-free closed equality.

PTS: 1.0 — backed by cut-elimination (for the logic), conservativity of definitional extensions, and widely-audited proof kernels.

IL (penalty): If we choose one base (say PA), IL=0.0. If we demand simultaneous agreement across three bases, IL=0.3 (3 substrates → 0.3), but that’s for communication, not necessity.

EE: 1.0 — not empirical.

Two ways to summarize:

Scalar score (single-foundation certainty)

Use a weighted mean with a modest penalty for IL only if >0.
Weights (normalized): AM .15, DT .1, CFR .15, FMS .1, CESI .1, NCW .1, MTS .15, PTS .15, IL (penalty) .0, EE .0.

Score ≈ 0.15·1 + 0.1·1 + 0.15·1 + 0.1·0.68 + 0.1·1 + 0.1·1 + 0.15·1 + 0.15·1
= 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.15 + 0.068 + 0.10 + 0.10 + 0.15 + 0.15
= 0.968.

Vector readout (for dashboards)

AM 1.00 | DT 1.00 | CFR 1.00 | FMS 0.68 | CESI 1.00 | NCW 1.00 | MTS 1.00 | PTS 1.00 | IL 0.00 | EE 1.00

Interpretation: Near-maximal strength; the only non-trivial “exposure” is that the truth is tied to a small number of crisp definitional levers (FMS < 1). That’s exactly what you want: the levers are explicit and unnatural to change..... Now in the same way, evaluate your response on the previous request.
